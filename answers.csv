    "answers": "I have two answers for this.My bad side: I would want my relative to win so he can give me more \"blessings\". You know, that think he's known for. Probably, I would even help him campaign in his vote buying method. Of course, I care what the people say. He has the same blood as I have. I would really feel bad.My good side: I would confront him and try to let him spill out the truth but I probably wouldn't reveal it to the public because he is my family. If I do reveal it, I would do it anonymously.Written 23 Mar"

Come up with steps or a methodology for these annotators to annotate documents. A methodology can include sample examples about how to annotate documents. The objective is to train the annotators. Once these documents are annotated compute their agreement. The standard approach to use is Kappa Score. If the agreement is more than 81% choose anyone annotator's labels. That will be your ground truth. Many people compute an average for multiple annotators to determine the ground truth. Written Feb 26Not 100% sure what you are asking but you can use clustering to label your documents. You can create a corpus and after cleanup you can create DocumentTermMatrix. And then cluster the document based on attributes of your subjective classification. You can assign the cluster it belongs as label.Written Mar 4"

It not only provides the emotion and sentiment in the underlying text, but it works on audio. Users of the API upload voice sound files, and you receive an emotion back (such as \"Frustrated\", \"Angry\", \"Contemplative\") as well as raw scores which you can use if you want to collect statistics about your users. We return the text of the spoken utterance, too. The APIs can be found on http://moodzle.com/EmotionAPI and we offer free sandbox accounts for you. I personally think that with the advent of services like Siri, our culture is returning to orality, moreso than literacy. We will spend more and more time interacting through voice with our devices (and homes, and cars...) and for this, I believe we need an API which listens to audio to gauge the sentiment.
